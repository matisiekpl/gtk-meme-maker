## Goal
The goal is to create very simple GTK demo app, that integrates all the skills learned at Programming course.

## Building from source
Requirements: `opencv`, `gtk` linked into `g++`
```bash
cmake .                                # Compiles
./cmake-build-debug/meme_maker         # Runs 
```

## Architecture
Project is written in C++. Uses GTK for driving UI components and OpenCV for bitmap operations. CMake is used as build system.
